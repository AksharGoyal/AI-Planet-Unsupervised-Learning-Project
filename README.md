# AI Planet Unsupervised Learning Project
## Project as part of Unsupervised Learning bootcamp

As part of the [Unsupervised Learning](https://aiplanet.com/bootcamp/certificate/verify/56f8d684-3635-44f2-84a2-da75d7c0026c) bootcamp organized by AI Planet formerly DPhi, I had to work on a project that helped with grouping FaceBook status. I had to use scaling and `kneed` module in determining optimal number of clusters for the data.

Take your time to explore the notebook and enjoy learning ðŸ“ˆ
